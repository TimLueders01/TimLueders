        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my webpage!</p>
        <p>Currently I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna. Before that, I was a student at the University of Greifswald.</p>
        <p>My research is centered around higher category theory and its applications in topology, geometry, and physics.</p>

        <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna. Before that, I was a student at the University of Greifswald.</p>
        <p>My research is centered around higher category theory and its applications in topology, geometry, and physics.</p>
        <p>At the moment, I am primarily thinking about the theory of higher dagger structures and its applications.</p>

        <h2>Ongoing projects</h2>
         <h3>Higher dagger structures</h3>
        <p>Higher dagger structures appear in the context of functorial field theories with defects or reflection positivity. 
          These are rather new structures and much of the theory is still in development. A key feature of the theory is that any higher category 
          with a sufficiently nice notion of duality gives rise to a higher dagger category; in low dimensions this is a theorem, in higher dimensions 
          this is a conjecture.</p>
        <h3>Higher Hilbert spaces</h3>
        <p>Higher Hilbert spaces appear as targets of fully extended unitary field theories.
          While concrete models for higher Hilbert spaces in low dimensions (e.g. von Neumann algebras) have appeared in the literature, 
          suitable generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are work in progress. One approach I am thinking about is realizing a good notion 
          of duality on higher categories of higher vector spaces, so that one may apply the theory of higher dagger structures to extract models 
          for higher Hermitian spaces (generalizing higher Hilbert spaces). </p>
        <h3>Twisted K-theory</h3>
        <p>Twisted K-theory appears in classifications of topological insulators and D-brane charges in physics. 
          While the basic theory is well-developed, generalizations and geometric descriptions are work in progress.
          I am currently thinking about a dagger-categorical perspective on various flavours of K-theory. As a motivation, ordinary
          vector spaces or modules with various flavours of pairings (symplectic, hermitian, quaternionic etc.) can be reconstructed applying 
          the theory of dagger structures using the fact that modules over star-rings carry a sufficiently nice notion of duality. </p>
        <h3>State sum models</h3>
        <p>State sum models (also known as lattice models) are among the simplest rigorously established functorial topological quantum field theories.
          Organizing the algebraic data necessary to construct such theories in a higher categorical framework is work in progress. The essential idea 
          put forward in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv:2504.17764</a> is that state sum models 
          for abritrary tangential structure should be recoverable from framed state sum models upon applying the theory of higher dagger structures. 
          This approach is motivated by the stratified cobordism hypothesis, refining the idea that fully extended field theories with G-structure 
          are fully extended framed theories for which a canonical G-action is suitably trivialized. </p>
